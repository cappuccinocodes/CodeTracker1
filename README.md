# CodeTracker1

CodeTracker1 is a simple beginner CRUD application designed to log coding time.

It was developed using ASP.NET C# and Sqlite.

The user can add, delete, update and read "coding time" data and generate monthly reports.

This is an application built as a form of study, so I decided not to use techniques such as repository pattern and libraries such as Entity Framework. 

----------------

If you're using this application to study, I have two suggestions:

1 - Expand on the application (for example, with extra reports)
2 - Recreate the application to track different data (for example, a budget application)
